		<h1>Exercise 2: Adding Prototype Functionality to Chat App</h1>

	<h2> Read Indicators: </h2>

	<p>
		In this video, we can see the read indicators in action. When a user sends a message, the message is marked
		as read when it loads for other users. We can keep track of all the messages that have been read by other users
		and all the people that have read a message. This is useful for group chats, where it is important to know whether
		people have read your message or not. Some additional functionality might be to specify specific users,
		but keeping the privacy of the users in mind, it might be better to just have a count of the number of people.
		Read indicators are only added for users that have not read the message yet. This is to prevent the read indicators
		from being too cluttered.

	<h2> Replies: </h2>
	<video src="../vids/vid5.mov" width="50%" controls></video>
	<p>
		In this video, we can see the replies in action. When a user clicks on the reply button, the current message
		has that reply attached, which can be deleted with the delete button on the reply. Once sent, the replied message
		remains a grayed out version of the original message, with the reply below it. The replied message includes the
		user that sent the message for clarity. This functionality is useful for users, as it allows them to reply to
		specific messages, which is useful for group chats, discussing specific topics and ideas, allowing for natural
		conversations to occur.
	</p>

	<h2> Profile Pictures: </h2>
	<video src="../vids/vid6.mov" width="50%" controls></video>

	<p>
		In this video, we can see the profile pictures in action. Each user can assign themselves a profile picture,
		which is displayed next to their messages. This is useful for users, as it allows them to personalize their
		chat experience, and allows them to easily identify who sent a message. This is especially useful for group chats,
		where it can be difficult to keep track of who sent what message.
