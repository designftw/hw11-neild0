<h1>
    HW13: Chat App Checkpoint
</h1>

<h2>
    Final design:
</h2>
<p>
    This chat app takes into account much of the user feedback I received during
    user testing. I wanted to make an app that would be useful to students trying
    to communicate about classes. After talking to students on campus, I identified
    that organization yet simplicity, were key parts missing from many chat apps.
    Complex systems like slack were overkill, but iMessage wasn't organized at all.
    Therefore, the goal of this chat app is to solve this problem.
</p>
<p>
    It does so through two main additions, pins and tags. The pins allow users to
    pin important messages for everyone in the chat to see; this is reserved
    for general messages that are relevant to everyone in the chat, usually deadlines
    or important announcements. On the other hand, the tags allow users to tag
    specific messages <em>just for themselves</em>, and they can also make as many
    custom tags as they would like. This add two level of organization: for the group
    and for the user. By separating these levels of organzation, is makes the chat app
    intuitive and effective for students attempting to communicate efficiently about classes.
