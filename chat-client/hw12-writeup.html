<h1>
    HW12: Chat App Checkpoint
</h1>

<h2>
    Final design:
</h2>
<p>
    The design that I'm working towards for my chat app is very similar to my Figma prototype, but different in a few
    key
    ways. I've decided to simplify the tagging process, by simply having one tag button that is assignable in each group
    chat. The tag and pin buttons will be visible at all times on the opposite side of the message, so it is easily
    accessible. The tag button for the group can also be used to set timers for the group chat, which will alert all
    users
    to specific deadlines, instead of being just for one user. Overall, I've taken all the feedback I got from my Figma
    prototype and tried to make the design more simple and intuitive.

    Description of turned in work:
</h2>
<p>
    This week's goal was to get the code functionality of the new features I wanted to add, without worrying about the
    design, which is what I achieved. I added the ability to pin messages, tag them, add new tags, and set timers
    (currently
    working on UI part of this). Now, it's mostly the work of making the UI look good, which I will be working on this
    week.
    This seems to be a good halfway point for the project, since the rest of the work is mostly repackaging the already
    existing
    data on the frontend in more visually appealing design elements, which I've planned out in the Figma. I'm excited to
    see how it turns out!
