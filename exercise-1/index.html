<h1>Exercise 1: Adding Animations to the Chat App</h1>

<h2> Animation 1: Movement for other people's messages</h2>
<video controls src="../vids/vid1.mov" width="50%"></video>
<p>
    To make new messages less jarring, other people's messages glide in the from the left.
</p>
<h2> Animation 2: Movement for your own messages</h2>
<video controls src="../vids/vid2.mov" width="50%"></video>
<p>
    To make your own messages more noticeable, your messages glide in from the right.
</p>
<h2> Animation 3: Movement for the send text</h2>
<video controls src="../vids/vid2.mov" width="50%"></video>
<p>
    When the user clicks send, it also gently pushes the send text up, to make it clear that the message is being sent.
</p>
<h2> Animation 4: Transtion between like and unlike</h2>
<video controls src="../vids/vid3.mov" width="50%"></video>
<p>
    When the user clicks like, it shrinks down and expands back up with the dislike text. When the user clicks dislike,
    it shrinks down and expands back up with the like text.
    This is to make it clear to the user that their action has been registered.
</p>
<h2> Animation 5: Fade out for deleted messages</h2>
<video controls src="../vids/vid4.mov" width="50%"></video>
<p>
    When the user clicks delete, the message fades out. This is to make it clear to the user that the message has been
    deleted,
    without being jarring.
